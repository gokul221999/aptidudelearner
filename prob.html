            <li> <span>Probability:</span>It is the quantitative measure of the chance of occurrence of a particular event. It tells about the chance or likelihood of the occurrence of a particular event. It can be expressed as proportions that range from 0 to 1, or can also be expressed as percentages that range from 0% to 100%. For example, a probability of 40 % (0.40) indicates that there are 40 chances out of 100 of the occurrence of an event.</li>
            <br><li> <span>Experiment:</span> It is an operation that can be infinitely repeated and has well-defined set of possible outcomes, which is known as a sample space. Each outcome is known as an event. For example, tossing a coin is an experiment that produces two well-defined outcomes: Head and Tail. </li>
   <br> <li><span>Random Experiment: </span>It refers to an experiment whose possible outcomes are known but the exact outcome cannot be predicted in advance.</li>
       <br>     <li><span>Sample Space:</span>
        It refers to the all possible outcomes of an experiment.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><span> Event:</span>It refers to a subset of a Sample Space. It is generally denoted by a capital letter "E".</li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Equally Likely Events:</span>The events in which there is no preference for a particular event over the other are known as equally likely events.</li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Mutually Exclusive Events:</span>The two or more events in which the occurrence of one of the events excludes the occurrence of the other event are known as the mutually exclusive events. </li>
                <br>
                <li><span> Independent Events:</span>The events in which the occurrence or non-occurrence of one event does not influence the occurrence or non-occurrence of the other event.</li>
