            <li> <span>Interest:</span> It is the money paid by the borrower to the lender for using the borrowed money.</li>
            <br><li> <span>Principle:</span> The total amount of money borrowed by the borrower is called principal.</li>
   <br> <li><span> Amount: </span>It is the sum of the interest and principal i.e. the total money paid back to the lender which includes principal and interest.</li>
       <br>     <li><span>Compound Interest:</span>The addition of interest to the principal sum each year or some fixed time period is known as compounding. So, the compound interest is the interest on interest. The interest of each year or some fixed time period is added to the principal sum and the new amount becomes the principal for the next year and interest is calculated on the increased amount for the next year.<br> Compound Interest is given by:
                <br>
               CI=p(1+r/100)^t - p
