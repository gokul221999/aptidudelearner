            <li>  t years ago the age of A was n1 times the age of B, and at present A's age is n2 times that of B, then;
               <br> A's present age =(n1-1/n1-n2)n2 * t <br>And, B's present age = (n1-1/n1-n2)*t</li>
            <br>
   <br> <li>The present age of A is n1 times the present age of B. After t years, age of A becomes n2 times the age of B, then;
<br>A's present age =(n2-1/n1-n2)n2*t<br>And, B's present age =(n2-1/n1-n2)*t
    <br></li>
       <br>     <li>The ratio of the present ages of A and B is p: q and after t years, it becomes r: s, then;
                <br>A's present age =(pt(r-s)/ps-qr) <br>And, B's present age =(qt(r-s)/ps-qr)
