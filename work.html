            <li> If A can complete a piece of work in X days and B can complete the same work in Y days, both A and B working together can finish the same work in (xy/x+y) days</li>
            <br><li> If a man completes  1/n th work in one day, he will complete the entire work in n days.</li>
   <br> <li>If a man can do a piece of work in n days, work done by him in one day =1/n part of total work in one day.
<br></li>
       <br>     <li>If A is thrice as good as workman as B or A can work three times faster than B, the ratio of work done by A and B for the same duration of time will be = 3 : 1. And the ratio of time taken by A and B to finish the same amount of work will be = 1: 3.
