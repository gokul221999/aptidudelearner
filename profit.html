            <li> <span>Cost Price:</span> It is the price at which a product is purchased. It is commonly abbreviated as C.P.</li>
            <br><li> <span>Selling Price:</span> It is the price at which a product is sold. It is commonly abbreviated as S.P.</li>
   <br> <li><span> Profit or Gain </span>If the selling price of a product is more than the cost price, there will be profit in the deal.
<br><center>Therefore, Profit or Gain = S.P. - C.P.<br> Gain % = (Gain/C.P)*100</center></li>
       <br>     <li><span>Loss</span>If the selling price of a product is less than the cost price, the seller will incur a loss.
                <br>
                Therefore, Loss = C.P. - S.P. <br> Loss %= (Loss/C.P)*100
