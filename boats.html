            <li> <span>Still water:</span>The water of a river or any other water body which is not flowing is known as still water.</li>
            <br><li> <span>Stream:</span> It is the flowing water of a river which is moving at a certain speed. </li>
   <br> <li><span> Upstream:</span>The boat or a swimmer moving against the stream is known as moving upstream i.e. against the flow of water.</li>
       <br>     <li><span> Downstream:</span>
        The boat or a swimmer moving along the stream is known as moving downstream i.e. along the flow of water.

            <li>The speed of a boat in still water is 5km/hr. If the speed of the boat against the stream is 3 km/hr, what is the speed of the stream? </li>
           <br> <ol><li>1.5 km/hr</li>
                <li>2 km/hr</li><li>2.5 km/hr</li><li>1 km/hr</li>
            </ol>
        
        <br>
            <li> A man rows downstream at 20 km/hr and rows upstream at 15 km/hr. At what speed he can row in still water?</li>
           <ol> <li>17.5 km/hr</li><li>18 km/hr</li><li>20.5 km/hr</li><li>22 km/hr</li></ol>
