            <li> <span>Natural Numbers:</span> The counting numbers which are used for counting are known as natural numbers, i.e. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and 9. These figures are known as digits. The natural numbers are denoted by 'N'. 0 is known as insignificant digit and other digits are known as significant digits.</li>
            <br><li> <span>Whole numbbers:</span> On including '0' in the natural numbers we get the whole numbers, i.e. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The whole numbers are positive numbers. They do not include any fractional or decimal part and are denoted by 'W'.</li>
   <br> <li><span> Integers: </span>The whole numbers including the negative numbers and excluding fractions are known as integers, e.g. -5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5. So, integers can be positive(1,2,3,4,5), negative(-5,-4,-3,-2,-1) or zero(0).
<br></li>
       <br>     <li><span>Prime numbers:</span>A whole number which is greater than 1 and is divisible by 1 and itself is a prime number, e.g. 2,3,5,7,11.
     
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Co prime numbers:</span>Two natural numbers p and q are said to be co-prime if their H.C.F. is 1, e.g. (2, 3) (4, 5) (7, 9) (11, 9).</li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Composite numbers:</span>It refers to a whole number which is greater than 1 and is not a prime number.It can be divided by numbers other than 1 and itself e.g. 4,6,8,9,10,12.</li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Even numbers:</span> An integer which is divisible by 2 is known as an even number e.g. 2,4,6,8.</li>
                <br>
                <li><span>Odd numbers:</span>An integer which is not divisible by 2 is know as an odd number e.g. 1,3,5,7,9.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><span>Unit digit:</span> The unit digit is the ones place digit of a number.  </li>     </ol><br>
