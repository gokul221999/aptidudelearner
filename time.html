            <li> <span>Speed</span> The rate at which an object is moving is known as its speed. It is the distance traveled per unit time e.g. an object moving at 20 m/s shows that the object covers a distance of 20 meters every second.</li>

            <li>A man covers a certain distance D1 km at a speed of S1 km/hr and, D2 km at a speed of S2 km/hr, his average speed during the whole journey is given by
                <br>Average speed =s1*s2(D1+D2)/s1*D2+s2*D1</li><br>
                <li>A man travels from P to Q at a speed of S1 km/hr and returns from Q to P at S2 km/hr, his average speed during the whole journey is given by:
                    <br>Average speed = 2S1S2/S1+S2
